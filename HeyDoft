Hey Doft,
Sorry to intrude like this but I haven't found any other way to reach you ^^.

I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your inputs given over the last few weeks and the whole new perspectives that opened. 
It is a very nice discovery and am happy to have done this first steps with you.
I really miss our conversations, as I am sure a good part of the discord does, but I understand that you may need some rest from all the discord nooise/activity.
I wish you a very happy Christmas and hollidays to you and your familly.
Stay safe !
Neo

PS: don't hesitate to come back if/when you feel better :)
